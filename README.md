# Laboratory_POO
In this example I will try to show how many days or months a person is present in the system of a laboratory with object-oriented programming (OOP or OOP) in Java. 

Here we have two files, the "Main.java" for executation and "Lab.java" for creation of object's atributes, getters and setters, construtors and methods.
